# About Me

## Before GA:
I was working at Charter as a senior software test engineer. Before that, I was a senior software engineer writing code for embedded systems.

## Outcomes support I need:
Definitely help with my resume so it reflects my experience/what I can do; also networking and interviewing because I really am not good dealing with strangers.

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Project goal: build a database-backed app that emails/text alerts on customizable conditions 
2. General goal: identify what would make me the happiest yet strongest developer (front? back? both? what??!)

## Two Truths and a Lie
1. We had to turn our microprocessor class homework in on paper tape.
2. I've been to Norway 4 times.
3. A bear once sat on the deck outside my kitchen window, eating the birdseed from the feeder.

## Meetups I've attended:

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I want to work for a smaller company creating products or a startup. I want to know who I work with; working for big corporations leaves you feeling like a nameless resource.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Not really qualified to answer that yet! I want desperately to be good at CSS, but that's coming a little more painfully than I expected. I'm definitely a code girl, so backend is probably the obvious spot for me, but I like the immediate visual response from HTML/CSS.
