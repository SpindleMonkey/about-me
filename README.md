# About Me

## Before GA:
I was at Charter/Time Warner Cable for the past 11 years as a senior software test engineer. Before that, I was a senior software engineer writing code for embedded systems.

## Outcomes support I need:
Definitely help with my resume so it reflects my experience/what I can do; also networking and interviewing because I really am not good dealing with strangers.

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Project goal: build a database-backed app that emails/text alerts on customizable conditions 
2. General goal: identify what would make me the happiest yet strongest developer (front? back? both? what??!)

## Two Truths and a Lie
1. We had to turn our microprocessor class homework in on paper tape.
2. I've been to Norway 4 times.
3. A bear once sat on the deck outside my kitchen window, eating the birdseed from one of the feeders.

## Meetups I've attended:
1. DenverScript 7/25
2. Women Who Code 8/10
3. DenverScript 8/22

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I want to work for a smaller company creating products or a startup (again, creating a product). I want to know who I work with; working for big corporations leaves me feeling like a nameless resource. I also want the time to make a product great in terms of usability and functionality. I want to make apps people like to use and want to use.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Not really qualified to answer that yet! I want desperately to be good at CSS, but that's coming a little more painfully than I expected. I'm definitely a code girl, so backend is probably the obvious spot for me, but I like the immediate visual response from HTML/CSS.

## Personal Branding Statement
30 second elevator pitch that answers the ages-old request "Tell me about yourself." 
_Use for resume summary statement_
Hi, I'm Connie. I'm getting back to coding, this time as a web developer, after years-long stints in software dev test and embedded systems software dev.

## My Story
An expanded version of my personal branding statement, shared at networking events and interviews
_Use for summary statement on LinkedIn and other social accounts_
I'm getting back to coding after several years in software test. I really liked working directly with the dev team as a dev tester, but reached the point where I wanted to write the code rather than test it. Before testing software, I wrote code for embedded systems and when I decided it was time to return to coding, I considered returning to embedded systems, but after exploring my options and what I'm interested in now, I decided web development was the place for me. I like the immediacy of the work--you're not waiting on a new board or a better servo; with web development, you have all the pieces you need on your laptop.

Who are you? What basic facts should people know? How do others describe you?
* detail oriented
* really like following data from source to screen/user
* seems I really like building out APIs

What makes you awesome? What are your unique strengths? What value do you bring to teams and companies?
* I've worked both sides: dev and test. I know how to debug code as I develop, and I also know how to debug code when I'm testing it (whether it's my code or somebody else's).
* I don't give up.
* I am *so* good with Google: dealing with lots of info, both good and bad; identifying questionable info; verifying info

Where are you trying to go? What are you asking for? How do you plan to get it?
* I want to code. I don't want to manage, I don't want to lead a team, I want to code.
* I want flexibility in my schedule (meaning the ability to work remotely sometimes, head out for doctor appointments, etc.)
* I want to keep learning

## Self-Reflection
* Core Values - what are your fundamental beliefs and guiding principles? 
*** Advocate for your customer, always.
*** Don't judge
*** Nice matters
*** Honest matters
*** Do what is right.
* Passions - what motivates and intrigues you?
*** I like process more than product (I'll spin/knit forever and don't need to produce anything ever)
* Vision - what does your ideal career look like?
*** Lots of coding, new features, occasional new products, new skills
* Strengths - what are your best characteristics and skills? 
*** Good writing/editing/proof-reading skills. 
*** I seriously like to debug
*** I get the work done, even if it means long days/weekends.
*** I've got this crazy midwestern work ethic
* Uniqueness - what sets you apart? 
*** I have a background in embedded systems which means I think about memory usage and efficiency. 
*** I also have a SW test background so I know what test wants from dev and from the product



PTARs
* trying to seed a many-to-many SQL database (postgreSQL); tutorials are pretty much non-existant, question/answers on stackoverflow are minimal; Sequelize documentation is actually there, but I had so little experience it took me 9 or 10 read throughs to finally get a handle on how to get the job done
