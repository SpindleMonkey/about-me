# About Me

## Before GA:
I was at Charter/Time Warner Cable for the past 11 years as a senior software test engineer. Before that, I was a senior software engineer writing code for embedded systems.

## Outcomes support I need:
Definitely help with my resume so it reflects my experience/what I can do; also networking and interviewing because I really am not good dealing with strangers.

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Project goal: build a database-backed app that emails/text alerts on customizable conditions 
2. General goal: identify what would make me the happiest yet strongest developer (front? back? both? what??!)

## Two Truths and a Lie
1. We had to turn our microprocessor class homework in on paper tape.
2. I've been to Norway 4 times.
3. A bear once sat on the deck outside my kitchen window, eating the birdseed from one of the feeders.

## Meetups I've attended:
1. DenverScript 7/25
2. Women Who Code 8/10

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I want to work for a smaller company creating products or a startup (again, creating a product). I want to know who I work with; working for big corporations leaves me feeling like a nameless resource. I also want the time to make a product great in terms of usability and functionality. I want to make apps people like to use and want to use.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Not really qualified to answer that yet! I want desperately to be good at CSS, but that's coming a little more painfully than I expected. I'm definitely a code girl, so backend is probably the obvious spot for me, but I like the immediate visual response from HTML/CSS.

Who are you? What basic facts should people know? How do others describe you?
* detail oriented
* really like following data from source to screen/user
* 

What makes you awesome? What are your unique strengths? What value do you bring to teams and companies?
* I've worked both sides: dev and test. I know how to debug code as I develop, and I also know how to debug code when I'm testing it (whether it's my code or somebody else's).
* 

Where are you trying to go? What are you asking for? How do you plan to get it?

## Self-Reflection
* Core Values - what are your fundamental beliefs and guiding principles? Advocate for your customer, always.
* Passions - what motivates and intrigues you?
* Vision - what does your ideal career look like?
* Strengths - what are your best characteristics and skills? Good writing/editing/proof-reading skills. 
* Uniqueness - what sets you apart? I have a background in embedded systems which means I think about memory usage and efficiency. I also have a SW test background so I know what test wants from dev and from the product
